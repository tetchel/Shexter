#Shexter - Shell Texter

Send and read texts from your Android phone using your Linux or Windows command line.

[Get client here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tetchel/Shexter/master/shexter_client/shexter.py)

[Get apk here](https://github.com/tetchel/Shexter/raw/master/shexter/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk)

You must [enable installation from unknown sources](http://www.androidcentral.com/allow-app-installs-unknown-sources) in order to be able to install the apk.

#Setup

In order to start using Shexter you must edit the client .py file to use your subnet IP address, which can be found by opening the Shexter app on your phone. The IP should stay the same until you reboot your router, but if the client starts freezing or is otherwise failing check if it has changed. Obviously I will change this in the future to be more user friendly.

Then, on Linux, cd to the directory with the shexter files and run the installer to have Shexter accessible from anywhere. 

No installer exists yet for Windows.
